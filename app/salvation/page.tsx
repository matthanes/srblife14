          Do you know for sure that you are going to heaven? If you’re like most
          people, you’re a little afraid to say “Yes.” You think it sounds a
          little presumptuous. I mean, can anyone really be sure?
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          Well, the Bible has good news for you. You can be sure. In fact, God
          wants you to be sure. And it’s not as complicated as you might think.
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          Let’s look at what God says in His Word.

          God clearly explains in His Word that we are all sinners. “All have
          sinned.” None of us is good enough to get into heaven on his or her
          own merits to spend eternity with God. “There is none righteous, no,
          not one.”
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          But God loves us so much that He provided a way. That way is through
          His Son, the Lord Jesus. By dying on the Cross, Jesus paid the full
          and complete price for our sins so that we don’t have to.
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          Because He shed His blood and died for us, Jesus Christ is able to
          fulfill His promise to freely give believers eternal life.

        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          In one sense, eternal life is what its name suggests: unending life.
          After all, if eternal life could be lost, then it is misnamed, because
          it wouldn’t really be eternal. All who have eternal life will live
          forever in God’s kingdom. No one who has come to faith in Christ will
          ever go to hell. Once you believe in Christ, your eternal destiny in
          God’s kingdom is guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          In another sense, eternal life is not merely unending life. It is the
          life of God. Indeed, John refers to Jesus Christ Himself as eternal
          life. Eternal life is God’s kind of life. It is life that comes from
          God. Thus a person who has eternal life has God’s life within him.
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          It is obvious from what we have just said that eternal life doesn’t
          begin when we die. Jesus said, “He who believes in Me has [present
          tense] everlasting life.” He didn’t say that the one who believes in
          Him will have (future tense) everlasting life. He said that he has
          eternal life–from that very first moment of faith. Thus a brand-new
          believer has God’s life, which is unending and full of potential.

          “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he
          may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall
          never die. Do you believe this?” She said to Him, “Yes, Lord, I
          believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into
          the world."

          It really is that simple. Take a second look at how Martha responded
          to the Lord’s question, “Do you believe this?”
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          She was definite and assured. Martha didn’t hesitate to say, “Yes,
          Lord I believe.” She believed that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah,
          the Son of God, the One whom the Old Testament prophets had foretold.”
          She knew that the Messiah gives eternal life to all who believe in
          Him. There was no doubt in her mind.
        </p>
        <p className="px-6 py-4 md:text-left text-justify">
          Like Martha, you too can be sure you have eternal life. The Bible says
          that you must believe in Christ for eternal life. Have you done that?
          If you have, then you are saved! It really is that simple!
