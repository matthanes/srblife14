        Nature of God
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        There is <strong>only one God</strong>. Through the{' '}
        <strong>Trinity</strong>, He reveals Himself to us as Father, Son and
        Holy Spirit:

      <ul className='list-outside list-disc px-8 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <li className='mx-6 mb-4 mt-2'>
          <strong>Father God</strong> cares for His creation and loves mankind
          unconditionally.
        </li>
        <li className='mx-6 mb-4'>
          The <strong>Son</strong>, the historical Jesus of Nazareth, is
          eternal. He was born of a virgin, died on the cross, physically rose
          from the dead, is alive today and is seated next to God the Father.
          Through His death, He provided salvation to all who believe.
        </li>
        <li className='mx-6 mb-4'>
          The <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> is the essence of a personal God who
          enlightens all men of their need for God and empowers those who
          believe.

        Mankind
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>Mankind</strong> was made in Godâ€™s own image as male and female
        and was the pinnacle work of creation. By their free choice they sinned
        against God thus bringing sin into the human race, yet human life is
        sacred and unique to God.

        Salvation
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>Salvation</strong> involves the redemption of the whole person
        and is offered freely to all who believe by placing their faith in Jesus
        Christ alone as their Savior, who by His own blood obtained eternal
        redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes
        regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification.

        Baptism
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>Baptism</strong> is the immersion of a believer in water. It is
        an act of obedience symbolizing the believer&apos;s faith in a crucified,
        buried, and risen Savior, the believer&apos;s death to sin, the burial of the
        old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ
        Jesus. It is not a requirement for salvation, but rather a demonstration
        of salvation.

        The Lord&apos;s Supper
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>The Lord&apos;s Supper</strong> is a symbolic act of obedience
        whereby believers remember the death and anticipate His second coming.

        Evangelism and Missions
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>Evangelism & Missions</strong> are the responsibility of every
        follower of Christ and therefore the church is to make disciples of all
        nations by sharing the Gospel and by a Christian lifestyle.

        The Last Days
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        In <strong>the Last Days</strong>, God, in His own time and in His own
        way, will bring the world to end as we know it now. Jesus Christ will
        return personally and visibly and the dead will be raised; and Christ
        will judge all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will be consigned
        to Hell. The righteous will receive their reward and will dwell forever
        in Heaven with the Lord.

        Cooperation
      </h2>
      <p className='mt-4 px-6 text-justify font-bodytext text-xl md:px-12  md:text-left lg:px-72'>
        <strong>Cooperation</strong> with Christians should organize to
        cooperate for the Kingdom of God. These organizations have no authority
        over one another or over the churches. Cooperation is desirable between
        the various Christian denominations.
